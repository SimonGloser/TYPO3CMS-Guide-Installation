Install TYPO3 via composer
==========================

The recommended way of installing TYPO3 is via Composer, as described on
this page. If you do not want to use Composer, follow the :ref:`package installation
guide <get-and-unpack-the-typo3-package>`.


To create a new TYPO3 project use the TYPO3 Base Distribution::

	# Download the Base Distribution, the latest "sprint" release (10)
	composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution YourNewProjectFolder

If you want to create a new TYPO3 project with a certain version, add ":version number" : ::

	# Download the Base Distribution e.g version 9.5
	composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution:9.5 YourNewProjectFolder
   
.. note::

   **For Windows users:** To install TYPO3 via the `composer` command, it should be started as admin
   or explicitly given the right to create symlinks (use for example a
   powershell or git bash started with admin rights).


After `composer create project ...` executed, you should have the following folder structure:
 
.. code-block:: none

    .
    ├── .gitignore  
    ├── composer.json
    ├── composer.lock
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── public
    ├── README.md
    ├── var
    └── vendor   
   
Point the document root of your web server to the `public` folder.
